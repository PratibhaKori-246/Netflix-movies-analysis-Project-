📊 Netflix Movie Data Analysis – Project Summary
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Netflix movies with the goal of extracting meaningful insights about viewer preferences, movie ratings, and genre trends. Using Python and Pandas, we explored, cleaned, and transformed the data to perform various forms of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

📌 Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Removed null values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns like Overview, Poster_URL, etc.

Data Transformation: Converted data types, categorized continuous values (e.g., Vote_Average) into bins like Non_Popular, Average, etc.

Feature Engineering: Transformed genres to categorical type for optimized processing.

Visualization: Created plots to show rating distributions, popular genres, and movie trends over time.

🔍 Insights Discovered:
Categorized movies based on vote averages into popularity segments.

Identified the most frequent genres and their rating trends.

Found patterns in viewer ratings that correlate with specific genres or release timelines.
